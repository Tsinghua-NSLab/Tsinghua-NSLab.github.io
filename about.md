## Seminars
In the NSLab Weekly Research Seminar, we study the design of modern data networks, concentrating on new and emerging research topics. Broad topics of interest include network algorithmics and architectures. Participants are expected to present recent papers on current research topics of interest and/or present results from their own research activities. A schedule of presentations appears below. This schedule is generated automatically, based on entries made on the scheduling form you will find here. Use this form to reserve a date for a talk or schedule a particular paper for presentation.
