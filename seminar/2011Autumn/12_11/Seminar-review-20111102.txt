Information[edit]DevoFlow: Scaling Flow Management for High-Performance Networks
Attendee: Jun Li, Zhen Chen, Yaxuan Qi, Baohua Yang, Xiang Wang, Feng Xie, Zhenlong Yuan, Yang Gao, Xiaoqi Ren, Zhi Liu
Speaker: Yiyang Shao
Recorder: Kai Wang
Presentation[edit]Software-defined networking
OpenFlow enables innovative management solutions
But OpenFlow is not perfect
Characterize overheads of implementing OpenFlow in hardware
Scaling problem in controller
Scaling problem in switches
Propose DevoFlow to enable costeffective, scalable flow management
Control mechanisms
Statistics-gathering mechanisms
Evaluation
Methodology
Metrics
Discussion[edit]Baohua Yang: Why can the size of flow table decrease 100x?
Yiyang Shao: Because the use of multipath wildcard rules and statistic method, only elephent flow will be sent to controller to set flow entry, so as to reduce the size of flow table
Yaxuan Qi: To think more about the problem of multipath, which is important to us.Appendix[edit]An Introduction of Network Switches. By Yaxuan Qi
