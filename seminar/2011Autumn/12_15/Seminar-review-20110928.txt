Information[edit]Chain-based DFA Deflation - Novel Approaches for Fast and Scalable Regular Expression Matching
Attendee: Yibo Xue, Zhen Chen, Feng Xie, Xiang Wang, Yiyang Shao, Yang Gao, Zhenlong Yuan, Fuye Han, Zhi Liu
Speaker: Kai Wang
Recorder: Baohua Yang
Presentation[edit]Background
Firewall, filtering, monitoring, IDS, etc
Construction time and matching time
DFA is fast, but have exponentially large number of states
Hardware accelerate, requires that volume is precions
Need a space efficient representationMotivation
How to represent DFA more compactly?
Cannot reduce the states, but reduce the transitions
Many states have similar transitions, reduce these transitionsAlgorithms
Inside chain
D2FA, A-DFA
FEACAN, Cluster-DFA, RCDFA
Intra and inside chain
Chain-based DFAConclusionDiscussion[edit]Yibo Xue: Is there a practical solution?
Kai Wang: All methods talked here require a pre-construction of DFA.
Baohua Yang: Generate compressed DFA from NFA directly?Appendix[edit]How to write a high-quality paper? by Yaxuan Qi
A good paper should meet:
Background (Hot Topics) + Algorithms + Experiments (Compared with enough works)
Phd should read lots of papers, and attend the discuss very actively!
