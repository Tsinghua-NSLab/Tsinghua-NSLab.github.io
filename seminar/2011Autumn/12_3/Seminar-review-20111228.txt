Presentation[edit]Background
	TRILL: stems from STP, to scale L2
	VXLAN: stems from VLAN, to virtualize L2TRILL
	starts 2009.5 RFC5556; flourishes 2011,7-8 RFC6325; supported by Cisco, Huawei
	solve routing issue in large-scale network
	combines both L2 and L3 advantages: multi-path, simplicity
	Two headers (Ethernet header + TRILL header) are added before original Ethernet frame
	routing with IS-IS protocol at L2VXLAN
	starts 2011.8 Internet draft
	L2 over L3 tunneling scheme for multi-tenancy network
	physical: L3, logical: L2
	VLAN ID: 14bits => VXLAN seg: 24bits
	Outher Header(Ethernet + IP + UDP) + VXLAN header are added before original Ethernet frame

Juniper's chanllenge on TRILL
	TRILL ignores IP, traditional multicast cannot adapt to
	TRILL has at least 2 tiers, imposes processing overhead
	TRILL has large broadcast domain
	TRILL cannot solve congestion management
	TRILL does not touch multi-tenancy
	TRILL's operational simplicity?HP's chanllenge on VXLAN
	VXLAN takes CPU processing
	VXLAN does not touch multi-path
	VXLAN only for virtualized resouce access
	VXLAN does not address L3 routingJun Li:
	where to do VXLAN encap? Efficient way is at physical server, then network fabric is simple.
Yaxuan:
	TRILL does not touch multi-tenancy
Jun Li:
	fundamental reason is large scaleBaohua:
	Is HTTP enough? Is clean Slate necessary?
Yaxuan:
	Why take Facebook as a instance?
Zhen Chen:
	collaborative cache becomes important since Video over HTTPJun Li:
	reseach of TCP congestion is moving to datacenter
	fast TCP is latest solution
