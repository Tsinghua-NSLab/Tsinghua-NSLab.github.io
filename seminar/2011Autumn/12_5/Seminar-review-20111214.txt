Presentation[edit]Background
	The world is an over-crowded place
	Google and experts cannot well help us find our interestsApproaches of RS
	Collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based)
	Content-based filtering
	HybridExisted Problems
	Data sparse with less correlation
      Similarity computation in different dimensions
      Relevance among data
      Cold startRBRA: Rating-Based Recommender Algorithm
	Contributions
     New similarity computation model
     Adaptively integrate user-based and item-based
Advantages
	Not care about the correlation
	Similarity computation in the same dimension
	Eliminate the relevanceDiscussion[edit]Q-Baohua: 
 why sparse? shall we use the u-i matrix?
A-Feng: 
 long-tail interest distribution, so they are sparce
Q-Yiyang: 
 can we transform the matrix?
A-Feng: 
 someone has done this, reduce something
Q-Prof. Li: 
 suggest adding more experiments by keeping one of the factor unchanged.
 Should recommend hot things
Q-Yiyang: 
 Should recommend things user will pay for
 Recommendation based on user behavior?
A-Feng: 
 yes
Q-Yaxuan: 
 User reordering may help solve the sparse
