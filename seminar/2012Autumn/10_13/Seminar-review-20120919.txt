benefitsQ&A
Kyle Wang:does VMware develop networking virtualization?The different with Livecloud?
Yaxuan Qi:yes, but only on the VMware's hypervisor. Almost the same but solving different problems.
Prof Xue:why google has an all-time-the-same bandwidth?
Yaxuan Qi:One datacenter can serve for many request from different places whose time zone is different.
Prof Li:what is the distribution controller?
Yaxuan Qi:the distribution controller with resources are one part that can be used. Kernel accessing into the resources will pay a heavy price. 
Xiang Wang:what is the different between Network hypervisor and network os?
Yaxuan Qi:NH acts as a flowvisor. And OS will use the flow entry which is distributed by NH to realise network control.
Prof Li: is nos a controller?
Yaxuan Qi:livecloud is an application that is different with nos and NH.
Kyle Wang:NH will control the netowrk slicing or be controled.
Yaxuan Qi: The administrator will control the NH but this work is different with the upper networking.
