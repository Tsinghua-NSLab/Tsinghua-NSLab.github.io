Presentation[edit]Unveiling Core Network-Wide Communication Patterns through Application Traffic Activity Graph Decomposition
Outline
Application traffic activity graph (TAG)
Decomposing application traffic activity graphs
Interpretation of TAG subgraphs
Temporal properties of TAG subgraphs
Applications
Summary and General remarksMethodology for network graph analysis
Decompose the graph (extracting community structures or dense subgraphs)
Interpretation and persistence of the subgraphs (identifying non-random substructures)
Understanding the formation of network graphs and associated applicationsInterpreting HTTP bi-mesh structures
Most star structures are due to popular servers or active clients
We can explain more than 80% of the HTTP bi-meshes identified in one day
Server correlation driven
User interests drivenSummary and General Remarks
Many network research questions can be formulated as “graph analysis” problem
These graphs are mostly not random and have latent structures
We propose a co-clustering (tri-Nonnegative matrix factorization) based method for decomposing such graphs and reveal the community structures (dense subgraphs).
Obtained subgraphs are meaningful and persistent, which help understand the formation of complicated communication graphs
We demonstrate various applications based on the decomposition results
