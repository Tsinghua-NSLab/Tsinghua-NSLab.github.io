Presentation[edit]Problems: 
TCAMs are power-hungry
Design a TCAM-based method that:  
Greatly reduces power consumption of TCAMs, especially for large classifiers
Uses commodity TCAMs
Is easy to implementChallenges:
How to active a small number of blocks?
How to know which blocks to activate? 
How to build an efficient pre-classifier?Solutions: SmartPC (Smart Pre-Classifier)
Two stage classification system
First stage: pre-classifier
Second stage: two parallel searchesSteps:
Built on two dimensions: source IP address and destination IP addresses
Shuffle original rules into different TCAM blocks accordingly
By expanding and combining two dimensional rules recursivelyProperties:
Entries in a pre-classifier are non-overlapping
Each rule in a classifier is either covered by only one pre-classifier entry, or marked as general
Q&A:
Prof. Li: 该算法可能出现的问题是：无法将规则集分开，与规则的初始划分相关。
Prof. Li: 该算法对规则的划分很可能不是最优的，没有像ParaSplit那样的递归选优的过程
Prof. Li: 该算法的memeory overhead是引入的pre-filter所占用的TCAM。overhead不大，但是带来的功耗降低是比较明显的，这样的改进make sense，请大家注意此类方法。
