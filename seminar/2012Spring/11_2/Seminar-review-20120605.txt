ConclusionResults
EffiCuts require many more SRAM accesses than TCAMs
Extended TCAM and TreeCAM require only at most 8 accesses even for 100,000 rule classifiers
Extended TCAM does not handle updatesConclusion
Previous schemes do not perform well in both lookups and updates
TreeCAM uses three techniques to address this challenge:
Dual tree versions: Decouples lookups and updates
Coarse trees for lookups and fine trees for updates
Interleaved layout bounds the update effort
Path-by-path update enables non-atomic updates which can be interspersed with packet lookups
TreeCAM achieves 6 â€“ 8 lookup accesses and close to ideal TCAM for updates, even for large classifiers (100K rules)
