Presentation[edit]Desires for Classification Algorithms
	No Payload Inspection
	Independence of flow directions
      Real-time Classification
      Low Computational OverheadKey Questions
	Why do those MLs work so well for traffic classification? Any "Common Sources"of their discriminative Power?Discriminative Power of Features
	Port number and packet sizes are most important features for classifying uni-directional flows.Real-time Classification
      Sizes of first few packets in uni-directional flows are expressive enough.Role of Discretization
      Discretization makes every tested ML algorithms achieve high(er) accuracies.Conclusion
      We compared classification-performance of several commonly used ML algorithms on broad range of data sets.
      For real-time classification of uni-directional flows,port numbers and 1~5th packet sizes are important features.
      Discretization makes ML algorithms perform better.Discussions
      Baohua Yang：F-measure如何定义？
      Yiyang Shao：为什么离散反而效果好？离散化是如何具体操作的？
      Baohua Yang：离散提高准确性如何理解，另外由于个人的编程习惯区别很大，离散化的方法是否合适？
      Feng Xie：许多临近端口的协议不一样，如何做离散化？是否和文章实际测试时选择的协议有关？
      Kai Wang：C4.5和离散化的关系？
      Zhi Liu：匹配速度是如何比较的？哪些限制条件？
