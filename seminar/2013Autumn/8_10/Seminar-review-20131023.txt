Presentation[edit]Background
Web service latency is critical to service providers as well
Observation: Search Response Time (SRT) is lower at peak timeThis work
Explaining systemic SRT variation
Identify SRT anomalies
Root cause localizationImpact Factors of SRT
server, network, browser, query
Primary factors: network characteristics, browser speed, query type
Server side processing time has a relatively small impact
Variation in network characteristics
Residential networks send a higher fraction of queries during off peak hours than peak hours
Residential networks are slower
Variation in query type
Server processing time
Richness of response page
Summarizing systemic SRT variation
Server: Little impact
Network: Poorer during off peak hours
Query: Richer during off peak hours
Browser: Faster during off peak hoursImplications
Performance monitoring
Should understand performance equivalent classes
Performance management
Should consider the impact of network, browser, and query
Performance debugging
End to end measures are tainted by user behavior changesQuestion & Answer
陈老师：浏览器缓存、DNS影响文章中没有仔细考虑，这样得到的结论是否成立？
熠阳：搜索的页面做缓存情况与内容都比较少；SRT不包括DNS的请求应答
向阳：故障包括？
熠阳：客户端、服务端、网络传输三种类型
兆国：高峰时间？如何判定？
熠阳：上班时间，根据CDN接入带宽判定高峰；采集的数据是美国境内的Client&Server
