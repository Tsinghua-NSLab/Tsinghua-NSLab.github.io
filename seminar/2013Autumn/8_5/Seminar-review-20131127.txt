Presentation[edit]Definition
Complex Network: A complex network is a graph with non-trival topological features
Controllability: A dynamical system is controllable if, with a suitable choice of inputs, it can be driven from any initial state to any desired final state within finite time
Driver Nodes: the set of nodes, if driven by different signals, can offer full control over the networkMotivation
Whether some networks are easier to control than others?
How network topology affect a system's controllability?Questions
What is the minimum number of driver nodes (ND) of real-world networks?
How to locate them efficiently?
Which topological characteristics determine ND?
How robust of network controllability?Results
What is the minimum number of driver nodes (ND) of real-world networks? (maximum matching)
How to locate them efficiently? (avoid hubs)
Which topological characteristics determine ND? (degree distribution, P(kin,kout))
How robust of network controllability? (degree)Conclusion
Developed the tools to address controllability for arbitrary network topologies and sizes
The key finding, that ND is determined mainly by the degree distribution
Use the tools of statistical physics to predict ND from P(kin,kout) analytically, offering a general formalism with which to explore the impact of network topology on controllabilityQuestion[edit]Prof. Li: ER？随着幂指数越大，scale free越来越接近ER？
Yuanyuan Bao: 完全随机的网络
Yiyang Shao, Kai Wang: gama趋于无穷scale free与ER等同Zhaoguo Wang: 控制是什么？控制节点的多少与复杂性的关系？
Yuanyuan Bao: 控制网络中的节点可以使得整个网络呈现出更好的状态（从一个状态到另一个状态Prof. Li）
