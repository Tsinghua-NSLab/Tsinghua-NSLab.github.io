Example
Q&A[edit]Prof. Li: The symmetric key problem, only reasonable for point-to-point conversation?
Zhaoguo Wang: The supported platform
Yiyang Shao: The instant-produced name problem
Zhen Chen: Use exclusive-cache, there are papers addressing the problem
Zhenlong Yuan: Originally, there are malicious CCN nodes, how to protect?
Zhen Chen: The malicious node cannot affect the user due to the content sign.
Prof. Li: Strem mode, how to lookup name?
Zhen Chen: Overlay situation, underlay not support.
Prof. Li: buffer vs. cache, if not used by others, then it is a buffer usage, not cache usage.
Prof. Li: Understanding CCN must know the difference between dissemination and conversation
