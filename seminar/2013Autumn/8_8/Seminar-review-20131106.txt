Speaker: Zhenlong Yuan
Recorder: Zhi LiuPresentation[edit]How Tor works
Benefits, risks and challenges
Benefits of Cloud Infrastructure
Performance
Scale
Multi-homing and scale makes eavesdropping difficult
Elasticity forces censors to make hard choices
Economics
Security Challenges and Solutions
Involved Parities
Building Tunnels
Paying for Tunnels
Learning about relays
System architectureQ&A[edit]Xiang Wang: Bootstrapping network is control plane of COR?
Jun Li: Is Bit coin tracable?
Yibo Xue: Any modification about routing?
The same with TOR
A implementation of TOR
Yibo Xue: What about the latency?
Zhenlong Yuan: Which DNS requiring method is mainly adopted?
Mainly recursive method.
Jun Li: What is variation about domain name?
Why the TTL shows like this figure?
IP variation of this application is fast?
