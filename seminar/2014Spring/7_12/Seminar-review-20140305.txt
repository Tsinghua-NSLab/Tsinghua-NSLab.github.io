Presentation[edit]Structural Hole
Definition: when two separate clusters possess non-redundant information, there is said to be a structural hole between them.
Mining top-k structural hole spanners
Input a social network G=(V,E) and L communities C; identifying top-k structural hole spanners
Data: Coauthor, Twitter, Inventor
Result: Structural hole spanners are more likely to connect important nodes; Opinion leaders controls information flows within communities, while Structural hole spanners dominate information spread across communities.
Intuitions
Structural hole spanners are more likely to connect important nodes in different communities. -> Model 1: HIS
Structural hole spanners control the information diffusion between communities. -> Model 2: MaxD
Model One: HIS
Hypothesis: If a user is connected with many opinion leaders in different communities, more likely to span structural holes; if a user is connected with structural hole spanners, more likely to act as an opinion leader.
Model, Algorithm and Theoretical Analysis
Model Two: MaxD
Finding top-k nodes such that after removing these nodes, the decrease of the minimal cut will be maximized.
Hypothesis: Structural holes spanners play an important role in information diffusion
Model, Hardness Analysis, NP-hard
Approximation algorithm
Results
Metrics: accuracy (Overlapped PC members in the Coauthor network), Information diffusion on Coauthor and Twitter
Structural holes spanners of AI and DB form the new area DM
Information spread maximization; a case study on the Inventor network; efficiency
Applications
Detecting kernel communities, link predictionsQuestion[edit]Prof. Xue：结构洞和弱关系是否一样？
A：不一样。且本文量化了结构洞，弱关系应该还未量化。
Zhe：评测，准确性怎样讲？
A：人工找overlapped PC members
Prof. Xue：这个方法适合多大网络规模？
A：从时间消耗来看问题不大。
Zhaoguo Wang：社交网络中群体会动态调整，随着时间变化，有没有可能预测出结构洞的产生或消除？
A：有意义，难量化。
Zhi：原算法与近似算法中最小割部分细节。
Xiang：Coauthor中只展现了几个图，其他的估计结果不好？
A：可能。另讲了数据是如何获得的。
Chang：计算到的结构洞与团体如何划分有密切关系？
A：是的，以团体划分为前提，比如以关系、属性、内存意义。从应用出发。
