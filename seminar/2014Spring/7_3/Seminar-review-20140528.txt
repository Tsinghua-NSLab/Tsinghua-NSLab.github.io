Presentation[edit]Motivation (Mobile Traffic)
Relevant: more personal information
Challenging: frequent IP changesChallenges (How to track users when they hop over different IPs)
Sessions: Flows(5-tuple) are grouped into sessions
Traffic Markers: Identifiers in the traffic that can be used to differentiate usersDataset
3h-Dataset: main dataset for most experiments
9h-Dataset: for quantifying privacy leakage
Ground Truth Dataset: for evaluation of session attribution (RADIUS: provide session owners)Methodology Overview
Traffic attribution: via traffic markers, via activity fingerprinting
Mosaic construction: network data analysis, web crawlingTraffic Attribution via Traffic Markers
Traffic Markers
Identifiers in the traffic to differentiate users
Key/value pairs from HTTP header
User IDs, device IDs or sessions IDs
OSN IDs as Anchors
The most popular user identifiers among all services
Linked to user public profiles
Block Generation
Group Sessions into Blocks
Culling the Traffic Markers
Can the traffic marker differentiate between users?
How long does a traffic marker remain the same?
Traffic Attribution
Connecting the DotsTraffic Attribution Evaluation
OSN profiles provide static user information (education, interests)
Analysis on network data provides real-time activities and locations
Information from both sides can corroborate to each otherPreventing User Privacy Leakage
Traffic markers (OSN IDs and etc.) should be limited and encrypted
Third party applications/developers should be strongly regulated
OSN public profiles should be carefully obfuscatedConclusionsDiscussion[edit]Xiang Wang: RADIUS指的是什么？ Answer：应该是手机用户认证。
Chengqi Yi: 为什么只有10%左右的USER ID获取，而能够主动爬取社交网络达到20%？Answer：未看到作者相关介绍和解释。
Zhenlong Yuan: DNS 的Top-5实验是如何做出的？ Answer：基于第三方移动运营商提供的GroundTruth。
Zhen Chen: 手机上网到移动基站的过程中应该没有IP层协议传输？Answer：IP传输其实发生在移动基站到真正的目的网络地址之间。
