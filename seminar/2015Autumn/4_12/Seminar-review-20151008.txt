Speaker: Yiyang Shao, Zhenlong Yuan.
Recorder: Zhi Liu
Presentation[edit]Part 1: Introduction to cryptology (Zhenlong Yuan)
Basic Model of encryption
Basic concepts:
Cryptography
replace
rearrange
Cryptanalysis
Modern algorithms: separate the key and algorithm
Symmetric algorithms: AES, DES, IDEA, Blowfish, RC2, RC4
 Drawbacks: need the distribute the key
 Unsymmetric: RSA, DSA
 Drawbacks: Not simple, slow Different Categories of attacking encryption system Details about symmetric encrption
 e.g. DES: 64 bits block based
 comparison of algorithms 
 Details about public-private key encryption
 Use case: encryption, signature
 Use signature and encryption together
Part 2: Blindbox: Deep Packet Inspection over Encrypted Traffic (Yiyang Shao)
 Motivation
 Deep Packet Inspection: (IPS, IDS)
 Entities involved: Client, Server, ISD, rule generator (Macfee)
 Challenge for DPI: Increasing use of using HTTPS State of art: man in the middle Contribution: Achieve Privacy + functionality
 First system to allow DPI traffic without decrypting the traffic
 Practical performance
 Support exact matching and (partially) regex Blindbox model:
 Middlebox: honest (run DPI correctly) but curious
 Rule Generator: generates rules correctly Blindbox HTTPS overview
 data transfer plane
 detection plane Blindbox Hand shake
 An exchange between the middlebox and the client at the beginning of a new connection.
 Based on two known techniques: Garbled Circuits and Oblivious Transfer. BlindBox Encrypt
 At the Client
 Middlebox SetupDiscussion[edit]Zhe Fu: Is the HTTPs in Blindbox unmodified?Yiyang Shao: Yes, the data is encrypted by unmodified SSL in Blindbox, and data is also encrypted again using Blindbox encrypt.Zhaoguo Wang: If the data transferred has already been encrypted, how could it be detected by the blindbox protocol?Yiyang Shao: If the data (malicious) transferred is already encrypted, it should be no harm to the user because the user (receiver) don't know it should be decryptedXiaohe Hu: What happened when salt is changing?Yiyang Shao: The client and middlebox will change the salt according to the token encounter. And the searching tree will be updated in the middlebox.Xiaohe Hu: Why is regex hard to support?Zhi Liu: Because blindbox use segment (token) based matching, regex rules like "abc.*" will expand to huge number of segments that blindbox need to match.Yibo Xue: Can obilivious transfer guarantee the privacy of the ruleset and the key?Yiyang Shao: There's a 20 page version of this paper, and some proof is provided there.Yibo Xue: Is the performance actually tested? Or calculated?Yiyang Shao: Actually tested, and compared with Searchable encryption and Functional Encryption.
