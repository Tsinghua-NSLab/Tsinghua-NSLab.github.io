Presentation[edit]Background of GFW
IP blockade
RST
DNS pollution
DPI
DDoS Key problem
How do governments find the proxiesGFW vs Tor
Tor   : Use public Tor network
GFW : Download consensus and block relays
Tor   : Use private bridges
GFW : Use DPI to detect Tor TLS handshake
Tor   : Use pluggable transports
GFW : Use DPI + Active probingExperiments about active probing
Shadow Infrastructure
Clients in China from CERNET Network and Unicom ISP
Servers in Amazon AWS 
EC2-Vanilla,EC2-Obfs2,EC2-Obfs3
Time span:3 months
Sybil Infrastructure
Forwarding 600 ports to Tor port
Time span:20 hours
Server Log Analysis
Application logs of a Tor bridge
Time span:5 years
Datasets
16,083 unique prober IP collected 
135 of Shadow
1,090 of Sybil
14,802 of Log
Fingerprint
TSval slope: timestamp clock rate
TSval intercept: (rough) system uptime
Several pysical probing systemsReflection from patterns
Active probing connections leak shared state
GFW likely operates only few physical systems
Thousands of IP addresses are controlled by central sourceEvaluation fo active probing
real time
efficient
no use of blacklist
pluggable censorship
Discussion[edit]Jun:How about blocking probing IPs of GFW?
Yibo:GFW makes use of a large amount of IP addresses. Some personal IP addresses are expropriated temporarily.
Jun:When bugs of foreign enterprise are found,should we report them to the government first?
Dujuan:The government will decide whether the bugs should be fed back.
Yibo:The USA government tracks network connection worldwide for potential use in the future.
