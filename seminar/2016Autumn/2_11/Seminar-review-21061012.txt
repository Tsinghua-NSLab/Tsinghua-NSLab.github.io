Background Knowledge[edit]Typical cloud deployment in Datacenter
Switch hierarchy
ToR switch
Access switch
Core switch
Virtualization
virtual machine/hypervisor
tenant
tunnelSimilariy between sets
Simple jaccard similarity
Using samples to approxmiate the jaccard similarity
Min-hash
min-wise/independence
prove correctness using indicatorshare data for similarity comparison

evaluationDIscussion[edit]Jun Li：Can we reverse the process and zoom into the system when the outage occurs?
Ju Xing: Yes, there is some work on such area. This paper focus on finding unreliable dependencies in prior.
Jun Li: In the exchange process, who generate the distribute the keys？
Ju Xing: There is a third-party generate the keys with the desired property
Zhe Fu: How is "minimal fault set” used
Ju Xing: It is used for internal analysis cases, when all the dependencies are aware
