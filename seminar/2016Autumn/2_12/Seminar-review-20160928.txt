Bitmap Indexing[edit]Research:
binning
coding
compressionTwo kinds of work load:
OLTP (Online transactional processing)
OLAP (bitmap used)Why bitmap indexing
维度诅咒

 ConclusionDiscussion[edit] Jun Li: Is this related to network forensics data, or general data?
 Zhen Chen: General network data.
 Dujuan Gu: Current Spark always dies on large scale data.
 Zhen Chen: VAST should also be compared with Druid.
 Zhi Liu: Is different bitmap indexing methods focus on compressing?
 Zhen Chen: Mostly on calculating and querying.
 Jun Li: Bitmap, bloomfilter, hash, is the basic techniques that students should know.
