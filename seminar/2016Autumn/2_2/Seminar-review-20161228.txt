案例Discussion[edit]Ju Xing: It is possible to solve only some specific security problems using big data, and achieve high accuracy?
Dujuan Gu: Current works are done in this way. Some works have reached pretty high accuracy in public dataset such as KDD dataset, but the problems in real cases are much harder.
Zhi Liu: What is the work of security experts when they troubleshoot each problem?
Dujuan Gu: It's always a empirical procedure, some assumptions are made, some tools are used to investigate the problems and make verifications.
Dujuan Gu: And a lot of the procedures need to be automated, varieties of security-related utilities and abilities are required.
