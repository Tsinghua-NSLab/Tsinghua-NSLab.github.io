BF could just tell Yes/No
More RegEx pattern typesDiscussion[edit]Prof. Jun Li: Methods of preprocessing payload or preprocessing pattern can be used to solve different problems.Prof. Jun Li: BF works well when matchings rarely occur.Zhi Liu: How to trace the source in practical cases?
Ali: Deploying systems in each gateway might be a solution.Prof. Jun Li: To store data and achieve information forensics could be an expensive problem. The method is kind of tradeoff.Prof. Jun Li: Can the processing capacity match large bandwidth?
Ali: A 4-cores CPU and 4GB ram can reach to the processing capacity for over 220Mbps bandtidth.Prof. Jun Li: The method is to against unknown attacks. Known attacks do not need to store data and achieve forensics.Prof. Jun Li：For cases with large-scale data, preprocessing data could be a better solution rather than preprocessing patterns.
