 Introduction
Focus: AI in security and SDN;
Share: experience and point of views;
Software industry history
 how to digitize human: AI
 AI DEFINITION:
 Development:
fun thing: go game;
facts: AI replacing Jobs;
True facts: AI filling Jobs; Fill the gap, but not to replace; AI serves as a compensation for the works that can't be finished by human.
 Security Industry:
 Definition and Problem:
 Modern Era AI in Security Industry
 AI category
 supervised learning from labeled data;
 unsupervised learning from labeled date;
 How to apply AI to good guys
 anti-spam/phishing
 anti-virus/ransomware
 Url-filtering Technology:
 IP Reputation: blacklist some bad IP
 Intrusion Hunting/ Detection/Prevention
 fraud detection
 incidence response
 API security
 data leak
 SDN
 AI with SDN
AI brain and SDN eyes & ears, hands & feet;
Network is the new security
 Conclusion: AI with SDN is the 10x Good Guys

 The Power of Compound Caches in the OVS Pipeline
 Software Switch Performance
 Distraction: kernel vs. userspace vs. mix
How OVS achieves high performance for complex pipelines
 Key #1: Packet I/O Methods
 Key #2: Low per-packet overhead
 Key #3: Low Packet Processing Cost
Caches in Networking Software
 Simple Caching
 Compound Caching
 More About Compound Caching
 OVS Performance ComparisonDiscussion[edit]Q: How do AI detect malware in detail?
A: Extract feature : kind of API, Library, time of file modified... many dimension of features. Learned data from millions of malware before.
Q: Do we have AI applied in network industry?
A: Sure, for example: google: datacenter, no firewalls no VPNs (past) now: treat everyone as bad guy. no monitor, but use machine learning to analyze the action of the employers.
Q: What form will the future AI be? Service? Box? Anything else?
A: AI is a technique itself, but not a product. It's just an implementation detailed work, but not an application. AI in the long term is not likely to be the face of some product, but AI just serve as backplane to do better work.
