Discussion[edit] Zhi Liu: When MBPE is modeled as SCP(Set Cover Problem), does every rule need to cover every node?
 Danyang Li: Every policy has different rules, we need to find a set of them to satisfy conditions.
 Yibo Xue & Jun Li: Are there any words to better describe the problem besides Policy Assignment?
 Jun Li: I discussed with Xiaohe Hu that maybe "distribution" is OK but not sure, the problem is open for discussion. There is a lot of work to do in network forwarding and network service. A student from EE has also studied the problem from a angle which is different from this paper.
 Zhi Liu: How to solve resource utilization and the updating problem?
 Jun Li: It is important to reduce the utilization of invalid bandwidth in network service, minimize and optimize the nodes.
 Zhi Liu: Is there a better way to describe the question? There may be a little confusion when using the "\subseteq".
 Jun Li & Danyang Li: Just form the  problem in mathematics to adopt the greedy algorithm later, need to think about it.
 Zhi Liu: It is iteration rather than recursion.
 Danyang Li: Oh, I will fix it.
 Jun Li: About the rule sets, we may not have that much data to find the characteristics of the rule sets.
 Zhi Liu: I have also considered the problem maybe we can study further.
