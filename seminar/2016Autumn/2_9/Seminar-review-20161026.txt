Conclusion
Use automated method to describe the potential behavior of the softwareDiscussion[edit] Jun: Is there anyboby care about Authority Description？
 Zhaoguo: Few, but there are such person reviewing the instructions carefully before installing. The Problem is permission management mechanism is not so good.
 Dujuan：The original method is marked by experts,and now we want to use machine learning to solve this probelm,but it's very hard.
 Jun: This is the confrontation between people,really difficult.
 Zhaoguo:The KEY to judging malware is to see whether it is known for the user.
