Construct Interval mapping
EncryptValue
Use pseudorandom function
Use IPv6 to avoid collisions
Pseudorandom function seeded by 5-tupleEvaluationConclusionDiscussion[edit]Xiaohe: Why upload encrypted payload to cloud?
Zhi: Otherwise enterprise gateway need to cache all the packets uploaded to the cloud.Jiaqi: How to deal with large prefix?
Zhi: mapping is from range to range.
Yiyang: IPv6 length is long enough.Dujuan: What happens if two rules with port 8080 and port 1234 mapped to one interval?
Zhi: Collision is in one interval.Shijie: How to deal with the condition that ruleset has large amounts of IPv6?
Yiyang: The mapped IPv6 field is like a private protocol. We can enlarge this field further.
Zhi: MBs should be enable to process IPv6.Xiaohe: The throughput is measured for Gateways or MBs of cloud?
Zhi: For Gateways, to measure encryption overhead.Zhe: keywords only for string match?
Zhi: In BlindBox the regex need to be decrypted first.
