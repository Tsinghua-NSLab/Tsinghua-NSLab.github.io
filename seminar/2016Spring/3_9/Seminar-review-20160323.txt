Presentation[edit]Oberserations:
Encryption increasing
In-Network Functionality is widespreadGoal: In function & encryption for 
Value-added Services
Admin-mandatedCurrent TLS + Middlebox solution, problems:
No mechanism to authenticate middleboxes
Client has no security guarantees past middlebox
Middleboxes have full read/write accessmcTLS design ideas:
Visibility & Control - Contributory Context Keys
Least Privilege (for middlebox) - Multiple Encryption ContextsmcTLS Handshake
Authenticate server
Authenticate middlebox
Distribute context keysPerformance Evaluation
Data Overhead
CPU Overhead
Time OverheadDiscussion[edit]Jun Li: When considering two way, number of keys doubles?
Yiyang Shao: YesJun Li: Formating favorable for packet parsing?
Yiyang Shao: The order of these mac is opposite to PPT.Jun Li: How does client know the list of middleboxes?
Yiyang Shao: The author says that this is not a problem for the protocol designer. Some thoughts in discussion section.Jun Li: Is there any other ways of doing relay?Jun Li: If there’s more problems here, maybe https will not develop very fast?
Dujuan Gu: In IDC and enterprise, they are already decrypted. But for carrier, it’s very hard.Dujuan Gu: Why LB matters?
Jun Li: Here the LB is ADC, it requires payload inspection. It needs to decrypt SSL.Yibo Xue: Carrier should be interested in this topic, but users may not want the contents to be exposed.
