ConclusionDiscussion[edit]Zhi Liu: There are some problems with the transitively of order-dependent R1,R2 R2,R3Prof. Jun Li: Order-independence means no overlap, which is relatively rare in the practical application.
Zhi Liu: There will be such situation in some cases, which makes the work meaningful.
Prof. Jun Li:  The overlap leads to many problems in the practical applicaitons,if there is no overlap, many interesting things can be done.Prof. Yibo Xue: Is there any evalutaion about the work?
Qing Lyu: No. Becuase only after the processing as shown in article, TCAM is used.Prof. Jun Li: If we just look at the results, the classification effect has been good enough.
Zhi Liu: Maybe the dataset has been well-classified from the kmrc.Zhi Liu: The greedysetcover algorithm is not the best choose, it can be improved by Intelligent optimization.
