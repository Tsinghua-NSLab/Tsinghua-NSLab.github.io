Presentation[edit] What the root cause of service outage?
 Root cause statistics
 Latent configuration errors
 google app engine outage timeline
 Configuration checking in system software
 Missing or Incomplete
 Result in latent erros
 Generate checkers according to usage of configuration values
 Emulation
Instruction extract
Context determination
Encapsulation
 Will it be safe?
Check utility
Semantic-based arguments checking
Capture anomalies
 EvaluationDiscussion[edit]Zhi: Will the system code limit retry times when do fail-over?
Ju: Maybe, But whatever the fault detection method is, it's already late.Prof. Jun Li: Do all the advanced language can be interpreted into intermediate representation?
Ju: Once you determine your compiler framework, the answer is yes.Prof. Jun Li: Is there any chance to do fault analysis in network? If you categorize the configuration into programming other than data, how to define "checking"?
Prof. Jun Li: May be correlated failure prediction in network is a research topic.
