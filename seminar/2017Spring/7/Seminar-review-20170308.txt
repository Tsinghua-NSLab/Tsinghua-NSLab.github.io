 EvaluationDiscussion[edit]Ali: Can AP across the routers guarantee that the resulting spaces consist the whole space?
Zhi: Yes, because the AP within each router is a way decomposition of the whole space.  Ali: When calculating the none-overlaping spaces of AP, should subtract the result of each previous AP or subtract the union of the previous original rules?
Zhi: They are the same, and use either of them if fine.Prof. Jun Li: When a node in the ddNF represents empty space, should the node be removed?
Zhi: Deleting the node do not break the ddNF graph, but will destroy the table rewriting since that TBV in the node need to be referred to.
