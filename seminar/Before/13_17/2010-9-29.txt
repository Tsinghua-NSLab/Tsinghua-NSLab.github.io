Data sets A subset of around 250 snort rules where some had wild-cards with length restriction up to 512, and the remainder had unrestricted length wild-card terms.
Implementation details all REs in a single group, lazily build DFA states at runtime. t=30αd, x=2, ε=1/2, αc=1000, LRU cache. dual-core, 2.2GHz Pentium 4, 1GB RAM, Ubuntu7.04
Conclusion
A novel agglomerative clustering technique which optimizes the trade-offs among overall DFA size and processing costto combine the space efficiency of NFA and the processing efficiency of DFA
Concept of DFA samplesto estimate the processing cost
Efficient techniques for extracting high frequency and densely connected DFA portions to be stored in a staticto reduce the processing burden
A dynamic caching strategy that maintains dense connectivity among DFA states

何飞：怎么测Throughput？
薛老师：这篇文章算法很难懂，用到了很多数学知识，可能是搞数学理论的人写的。对于长流需要匹配很多次，匹配是否需要分成很多次计算？
张志明：flow和session的区别，何飞：flow表示的流要广些，如有相同源地址的packet组成flow；session表示的双方对话产生数据流。
唐力：征求学术活动改进意见，希望以后学术活动报告人能够不光讲自己领域的内容，这样没法调动大家讨论的积极性。在讲解时应该注意听众的背景，从不同层面和不同粒度准备讲解的材料，尽量使每个同学都能听懂一部分，有所收获。
