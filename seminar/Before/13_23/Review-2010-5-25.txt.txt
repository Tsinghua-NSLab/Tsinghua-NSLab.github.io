title: Topological Properties Affect the Power of Network Coding in Decentralized Broadcast
reporter: Zhiming Zhang
attender: all NSLab staff except Guodong Li, Rongxiao Liang
Q&A:
Baohua: Are there any theory analysis for these conclusions?
Dr. Li: Performance changes greatly?
Zhen Chen: useful info. in Cluster's structure?
	NC is slightly better than random?
Jin Zhou: how to do this simulation? Over all or individually? What is convincing?
		What extent the performance of algorithms is affected by Time-varying Topology is not very clear.
Baohua: validation specification of NC ...
	The need for interaction between peers for each algorithm?
