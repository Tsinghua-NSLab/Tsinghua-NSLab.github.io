Content:
1. Computer vs. Network, from low level to high level.
2. Introduction to NOX:
two concepts: centralized programming, high-level names
challenges: distributed algorithms, low-level addresses
NOX: to build an network operating system at a significate scale
3. NOX Overview
1) Components: apps over NOX Controller + NOX Controller over PC Server (+ Network view) + OF Switch
2) Granularity
 Overservation Granularity
 Switch-level topology
 locations of users, hosts, middlesboxes, etc.
 But NO traffic state3) Operation
4) Scaling: centralization for slow operations, and parallelism for rapid operations
4. Programming Interface
 Events
 Namespace
 Libraries
 Routing
 Packet Classification
 DNS
 Network Filtering5. Example Applications
1) Detecting Scanning Hosts
2) Ehane Project: one network-wide access-control system
6. Summary
 Netowrk management framework
 Good scalability for large systems
 flexible programming with high-level abstraction
