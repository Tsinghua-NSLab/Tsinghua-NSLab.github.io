Topic: Building Extensible Networks with Rule-Based Forwarding

Network’s core functionality is to forward packets
- A long-held goal: flexible forwarding

Flexibility alone is not enough
- Flexibility must be balanced by policy support
- Every forwarding directive can be constrained by policies
- Every entity that explicitly appears in a forwarding directive can refuse that directive

Goal
Flexible and Policy-Compliant architecture
- Flexible: path control, use in-network functionality and state
- Policy-compliant: all stakeholders’ policies are respected

Idea: Packet Rule
Forwarding directives carried in packet
- Current Internet – packet sent to destination
- Rule Based Forwarding – packet sent to rule

Rules tell network how to forward packets
Rules tell network which packets can be forwarded

Rule Properties
1. Flexible
2. Policy Compliant
3. Safe

Summary
RBF – flexible and policy compliant architecture
- Packets carry rules
Rule – contains forwarding directives
- Flexible: if-then-else conditions on packet & router attributes, modify packet header and use in-network functions
- Policy-compliant: signed by third parties – RCEs
- Safe: cannot corrupt routers or amplify traffic

Discussion: 

李老师：与作者之前提出的PSwitch相比，作者的研究思路为什么转到了这个方向？两者有何联系？后者是对前者的否定？应当跟进作者的思路，搞懂他的研究思路。

亚煊：作者在本文之后又发表了另一篇文章对此进一步展开说明，今后的学术活动可以再学习一下。
